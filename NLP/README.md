# Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) is a widely discussed and studied subject these days. 
NLP, one of the oldest areas of machine learning research, is used in major fields such as machine translation speech recognition and word processing. 
As part of this repository, I have implemented few projects on Natural Language Processing using **Python** and **Machine Learning**.

## 1.) Sentiment Analysis
In Machine Learning, Sentiment analysis refers to the application of natural language processing, computational linguistics, and text analysis to identify and classify subjective opinions in source documents. In this article, I will introduce you to a machine learning project on sentiment analysis with the Python programming language. Sentiment analysis aims to determine a writer’s attitude towards a topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. The attitude can be his judgment or assessment, his emotional state or the intended emotional communication. The main task is to identify opinion words, which is very important. Opinion words are dominant indicators of feelings, especially adjectives, adverbs, and verbs, for example: “I love this camera. It’s amazing!”
In this project Ihave built a Machine Learning model on sentiment analysis with Python programming language which predicts the sentiment of the texts.

<h1 align = "center" > Loan Approval Prediction </h1>

<p> In this project I have analyzed the "Housing Finance company's" data for home loan eligibility and approval process automation task. 
  This dataset covers data across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.
  Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, 
  Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process of loan approval, I have identified the customers segments, those are eligible for 
  loan amount so that they can specifically target such customers. </p>
